		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
			Unsurprisingly, the founder of Steve Kane Information Technology Solutions (aka SKITS) 
			is Steve Kane. Steve's collection of clients throughout central New Jersey had urged him 
			to make himself look more official. Step one: make a website. All he needs to do now is start up 
			the business and get some of those free business cards from Vistaprint that everyone is talking
			about.

			Steve currently plans to provide his <a href="../services">services</a> to people in central 
			New Jersey, but things change so don't hesitate to ask.
